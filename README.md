      <h1>Run Pizza Run!</h1>
      <em>72h Gamedev Competition Entry by Team Oxymoron</em>

      <h2>What is Run Pizza Run?</h2>
      <p>
        In "Run Pizza Run", you are Pizza Boy and have to serve six customers per 
        level. To do that, you collect all the ingredients needed for the pizza they
        request. Just run it and you'll see! The game should be completely self-explanatory.
      </p>

      <h2>Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        Pretty much any PC with 3D-accelerated graphics hardware should be able to run the
        game.
